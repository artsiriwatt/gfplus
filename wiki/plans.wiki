= Introduction =
This page contains details on what the current plans for [GMForts] are. These are only ideas so this page is subject to frequent change.

=Plans=
These are our plans for what GMForts will contain once it has been completed

=Gametypes=
At the moment, there are two types of gametypes that we are planning on implementing.

||*Name*||*Description*||
||Assault||Players start out with one control point from which they must branch out and capture additional control points. One team wins when they capture all of the control points and eliminate all enemy players. Spawners are located at each checkpoint.||
||Capture The Flag||Players begin in a designated area of the map and must build up their base in that area to protect their flag, and attack enemy bases as to steal their flag and bring it back to their base to score. The winner is decided by which team has the most points once the time left reaches 0. Spawners are located at each team's base.||

=Upgrades, Special Items, and Special Weapons=
Upgrades and special items will be purchased using Upgrade Points that each member of a team earns under certain circumstances.

===Circumstances when UP is earned===

*Assault:* Every minute that a control point in Assault is held, 1 UP is awarded to each member of a team. So if your team holds 3 control points for a minute, everyone on your team gains 3 UP.

*CTF:* When you or a member of your team takes a flag in CTF, you gain 1 UP. If you or your team then captures that flag, then you gain an additional 4 UP for a total of +5 UP.
