=Gametypes=
There are currently two gametypes for GMForts: Assault and Capture The Flag. Each has its own unique playing style and strategies for winning. CTF is more attuned towards fast-paced action and quick fire-fights on smaller maps, while Assault is much more strategic and has large maps designed for longer skirmishes.

||*Name*||*Description*||
||Assault||Players start out with one control point from which they must branch out and capture additional control points. One team wins when they capture all of the control points and eliminate all enemy players. Spawners are located at each checkpoint.||
||Capture The Flag||Players begin in a designated area of the map and must build up their base in that area to protect their flag, and attack enemy bases as to steal their flag and bring it back to their base to score. The winner is decided by which team has the most points once the time left reaches 0. Spawners are located at each team's base.||
