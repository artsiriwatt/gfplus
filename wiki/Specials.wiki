===Special Items===
||Name||Purpose||Notes||Types||Cost||
||Radar||A radar dish that detects intruders in a set radius around itself and displays them on your minimap and HUD.||Extremely useful for defending important areas because it gives you and your team early warning and provides HUD icons for easy location of the enemy.||Small Radar/Large Radar||Small Radar=10 UP/Large Radar=20 UP||
||Turret||A popup turret that attacks intruders within its line-of-sight.||Very useful for controlling chokepoints or defending important areas. Can be used for offensive purposes but due to its long deploy time, the enemy may kill the deploying teammates.||Anti-Infantry Turret/Anti-Vehicle Turret||A-Inf Turret=15 UP/A-Vehc Turret=20 UP||
||Deployable Spawner||Once deployed, players may spawn basic building blocks using this Special Item.||Useful if you wish to make a forward outpost or small base somewhere away from your main spawners, the only drawback is that you cannot spawn any of the more advanced blocks or Special Items.||N/A||15 UP||
