===Special Items===
||Name||Purpose||Notes||Types||Cost||
||Deployable Radar||A radar dish that detects intruders in a set radius around itself and displays them on your minimap and HUD.||Extremely useful for defending important areas because it gives you and your team early warning and provides HUD icons for easy location of the enemy.||Small Radar/Large Radar||Small Radar=10UP/Large Radar=20UP||
||Deployable Turret||A popup turret that attacks intruders within its line-of-sight.||Very useful for controlling chokepoints or defending important areas. Can be used for offensive purposes but due to its long deploy time, the enemy may kill the deploying teammates.||Anti-Infantry Turret/Anti-Vehicle Turret||Anti-Infantry Turret=15UP/Anti-Vehicle Turret=20UP||
||Deployable Spawner||Once deployed, players may spawn basic building blocks using this Special Item.||Useful if you wish to make a forward outpost or small base somewhere away from your main spawners, the only drawback is that you cannot spawn any of the more advanced blocks or Special Items.||N/A||15UP||
||Deployable Shield Generator||The Shield Generator creates a shield around a predefined radius that stops bullets and projectiles but lets players through until either A) The shield is destroyed by concentrated fire, or B) The shield generator is removed.||Primarily used for protecting an area from enemy fire while players build within the shield or to provide protection from incoming enemies, can be used offensively as a safe haven within which to spawn but concentrated fire from defenders can destroy the shield.||Small Shield Generator/Large Shield Generator||Small Shield Generator=15UP/Large Shield Generator=30UP||
