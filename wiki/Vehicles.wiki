Vehicles will be a useful part of GMForts that will provide critical roles such as transporting troops, providing fire support, or even leading an assault. They are something that your team should use with care due to their cost, but can turn the tide of a battle. They have two critical stats that determine how easily they can be destroyed by enemy fire: Health and Armor. Health is how much damage the vehicle can take, the lower this number, the less punishment it can withstand. Armor is the percentage of damage taken that is negated, the higher this number, the less damage from weapons gets through to damage the vehicle's Health.

||Name||Cost||Health||Armor||Weapons||Positions||Notes||
||Jeep||20UP||150||15%||A Heavy Machinegun and two seats for passengers to fire out from.||Driver, Gunner, Passenger #1, Passenger #2||The Jeep provides little protection from enemy fire and has low Health and Armor, but is the cheapest vehicle available and boasts a Heavy Machinegun and the #3 and #4 passengers may fire out at enemies providing it with surprising firepower. It is easily destroyed by turrets and small-arms fire.||
||Armored Personell Carrier (APC)||30UP||250||40%||A Light Machinegun||Driver, Gunner, Passengers #1-#6|| The APC is lightly armed but makes up for this by providing a quick trasport with more Armor and Health than a Jeep and is able to hold twice as many passengers.||
||Tank||40UP||400||60%||A Cannon, a Light Machinegun, and a Heavy Machinegun||Driver, Gunner||The Tank is the most powerful and heavily armored vehicle in GMForts. It can destroy bases with its cannon and is able to inflict heavy damage on infantry and vehicles alike. The Driver controls the main Cannon and the Coaxial Light Machinegun, while a second passenger may control the Heavy Machinegun mounted ontop of the turret with a 360 degree turning radius.||
||Helicoptor||35UP||200||20%||Two Rocket Pods and a Heavy Machinegun||Pilot, Gunner||The helicoptor has only slightly more Health and Armor than a jeep, but it more than makes up for this with its great speed, maneuverability, twin rocket pods and gunner-controlled Heavy Machinegun. Good for countering Tanks but easily destroyed by turrets and small-arms fire.||
