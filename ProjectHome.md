# Description #
Geo Forts Plus started out as an extension Night-Eagle's GeoForts gamemode for Garry's Mod. It added many fixes and gameplay improvements to the mod. [GMForts](GMForts.md) is a new gamemode based on what has been learned from GF+.

> Geo Forts Plus development has stopped and work on [GMForts](GMForts.md) (Short for Garrys Mod Forts) has begun as it's successor. There will be many changes from the origional GF+ and many new additions. We feel that these will be for the better and will help us to make the best gamemode possible
