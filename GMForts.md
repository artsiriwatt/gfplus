## Introduction ##
GMForts is the successor to Geo Forts Plus, a short-lived but popular fort building gamemode. It is a Garrysmod gamemode based around the gameplay aspect of building forts out of geometrically shaped building blocks and then assaulting the enemy's fort to capture their flag, gain control of a control point, or simply to destroy the enemy fort and deny them access to it.

## Details ##

GMForts is currently in it's development phase. It has two planned gametypes and a very large amount of new and improved content over it's predecessor.
