You may earn Awards for performing certain feats within a game. They appear underneath your name in the scoreboard when you or other players select it. There are 3 ranks of each award: Bronze, Silver, Gold. Bronze is the easiest to achieve of the three ranks and Gold is the hardest. They are earned in order, with Bronze being the first of the three that you can earn, then Silver, and then Gold. It is quite hard to earn a Gold award.

Certain Ranks require that you earn certain awards before they become available to you. Some of the later Ranks can be extremely hard to achieve due to the fact that they require several medals ontop of the already difficult requirements.
