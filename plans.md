# Introduction #
This page contains details on what the current plans for [GMForts](GMForts.md) are. These are only ideas so this page is subject to frequent change.

# Gametypes #
At the moment, there are two types of gametypes that we are planning on implementing: Assault and Capture The Flag. See the [How to play](Gameplay.md) section for more information.

# Vehicles #
Several vehicles are planned for GMForts that will be used to traverse the map and inflict damage on enemies.

# Stat Tracking/Awards #
GMForts is planned to have Stat Tracking for each player that joins the official server. They will be able to earn new Ranks, (which is merely a different player model and the bragging rights that go with it, possibly a few other goodies) and recieve Awards for performing certain feats.
